### Screensharing Discord Bot
This bot was made to allow the use of a little trick found to utilise channel screen sharing without the need of a server with the functionality.

### How do I set it up?
* Download the repository and extract the files to your desired machine.
* Navigate to the [Discord Developer](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) website and create your app.
* Once created, convert it to a bot and put your token into `app.js`.
* Run the app like any other Node JS application `npm start`.

### What else is there to do?
* Create a better way of storing sessions to allow inviting people after creation.
    * _Current way involves checking the timestamps of invites compared to channels._
* Some more stuff that'll eventually bug me enough to implement.

### Who do I credit?
**Myself** for converting the idea and project into a functioning NodeJS app with added security.
[**Jumpz12**](https://github.com/Jumpz12) for coming up with the initial idea and creating it into a Python app.
